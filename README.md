# Containers Cost Allocation (CCA) Dashboard

Welcome!
This repository contains a project for visualizing data from [Kubecost](https://www.kubecost.com/) in Amazon QuickSight as part of [CID (Cloud Intelligence Dashboards)](https://catalog.workshops.aws/awscid/en-US).   
Here we demonstrate how you can break down EKS in-cluster cost and usage in a multi-cluster environment, and visualize this data in QuickSight alongside the other CIDs, using data from a [self-hosted Kubecost pod](https://www.kubecost.com/products/self-hosted).

This project can work with any Kubecost tier:

* Kubecost EKS-optimized bundle
* Kubecost free tier
* Kubecost enterprise tier, with the following limitations:
  * Data for all clusters are included in a single file per day instead of file per cluster per day
  * AWS account ID will not be shown
  * The `eksclustername` dataset field will show the primary cluster name for any cluster.  
    Instead, you can customize the dashboard and use the `clusterid` field

Please note that OpenCost is not supported.

## Architecture

This solution is composed of the following components (in high-level):
* A data collection pod (referred to as "Kubecost S3 Exporter" throughout some parts of the documentation).  
It's used to collect the data from Kubecost and upload it to an S3 bucket that you own.
* A pipeline that makes the data available to be queried in Athena
* A QuickSight dashboard, along with its QuickSight assets (data source, dataset)

The AWS resources in this solution are deployed using a Terraform module which is provided as part of it.  
The K8s resources in this solution are deployed using a Helm chart which is provided as part of it.  
It's invoked by Terraform by default, but you can choose to deploy it yourself.
The QuickSight dashboard is deployed using the `cid-cmd` CLI tool.

More detailed information on the architecture and logic are found in the [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) file.
