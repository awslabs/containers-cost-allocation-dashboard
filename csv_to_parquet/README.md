# CSV to Parquet Conversion Script

This script is used to:

1. Get all gzipped-compressed CSV files from an S3 bucket
2. Convert them to Snappy-compressed Parquet files
3. Ipload the Parquet files back to the S3 bucket
4. Optionally delete the gzipped-compressed CSV files from the S3 bucket

The use-case is for users that used the Kubecost CID integration when it was converting the Kubecost allocation data to CSV, before the change to Parquet.<br />
It's used to provide an automated way of converting all the gzipped-compressed CSV files that are already on the S3 bucket, to Snappy-compressed Parquet files.

## Usage

1. Set the S3_BUCKET_NAME environment variable, with your S3 bucket name
2. If you want to delete the gzipped-compressed CSV files from the S3 bucket, set DELETE_OBJECTS environment variable to any value.<br />
To avoid deleting the gzipped-compressed CSV files from the S3 bucket, do not set the DELETE_OBJECTS at all.
